package Array;


/**

 Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

 Note:
 You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n)
 to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

 1)

 - A and B are sorted
 - merge B into A
 - A size is >= (m + n) so can hold B's elements

 - A has m elements initialized
 - B has n elements initialized


 2)

 int A = {1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 15}
 int B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}

 expected output = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15}
